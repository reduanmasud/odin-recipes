    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      North Indian in origin, I was very grateful to have found this recipe. It
      is very similar to what was served to us by our Bengali neighbors years
      ago! Serve hot with a side of thickly sliced bread.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided</li>
      <li>2 onions, peeled and quartered</li>
      <li>3 tomatoes, quartered</li>
      <li>2 small green chile peppers</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons garlic paste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ginger paste</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons ground coriander</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon garam masala</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper, or to taste</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
      <li>2 cups water</li>
      <li>1 large potato - cooked, peeled, and cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>6 hard-cooked eggs, quartered</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro <em>(Optional)</em></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in onions;
        cook and stir until onion pieces are soft and translucent, about 5
        minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low; continue cooking, stirring
        occasionally, until onions are golden, about 10 minutes more.
      </li>

      <li>
        Remove pan from heat and set it aside. Transfer cooked onions to the
        bowl of a food processor; grind onions, tomatoes, and green chiles into
        a smooth paste.
      </li>

      <li>
        Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in the same skillet over medium heat.
        Add onion mixture carefully, as it may spatter. Cook and stir for 2 to 3
        minutes. Stir in garlic paste, ginger paste, coriander, cumin, garam
        masala, turmeric, cayenne pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until the oil
        begins to separate from the mixture, about 5 minutes.
      </li>

      <li>
        Pour water into skillet and bring sauce to a boil. Add cubed potatoes.
        Gently stir in the eggs. Reduce heat to low and simmer until sauce has
        thickened slightly, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat.
      </li>

      <li>Garnish with cilantro before serving.</li>
    </ol>
